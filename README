1. Project Summary

Explain why the client needs a new website:

What is the most important purpose of this website
The primary purpose of the Ascent Physiotherapy website is to provide information about their physiotherapy services, including various treatment options like manual therapy, acupuncture, and personal training. It also facilitates booking appointments, allowing potential clients to easily access and schedule their services. Additionally, the site likely aims to inform the community about their team and facilities, as well as provide contact information for inquiries.

Who is the target audience? Perhaps there are multiple target audiences? 
 *Residents of Comox Valley: People living in or around the area who may need physiotherapy services.
 *Individuals with Specific Health Needs: Those looking for treatments like manual therapy, acupuncture, or personal training.
 *Athletes or Active Individuals: People interested in injury prevention and rehabilitation.
 *General Health Seekers: Anyone looking to improve their physical health and wellness through professional guidance.
Overall, the site is aimed at a community-focused audience seeking comprehensive physiotherapy services.

What is the overall message you are trying to convey to your target audience on this website? What action do you want the audience to perform before they leave your website? Are there multiple ways they could take action?
The overall message of the Ascent Physiotherapy website is to inform potential clients about the range of physiotherapy services offered, emphasizing their expertise and commitment to the health of the Conox Valley community. 
The primary action you want the audience to take before leaving the website is to book an appointment. This can be facilitated through the "Book Now" button prominently displayed on the site.
There are multiple ways the audience could take action, including:
 *Online Booking: Clicking the "Book Now" button to schedule an appointment directly.
 *Phone Call: Using the displayed phone number to call and inquire or book an appointment.
 *Contact Form: Filling out a contact form for more information or to ask specific questions.
 *Exploring Services: Navigating through the "Products & Services" section to learn more about specific treatments before booking.


Why is their current site not appropriate? There could be many reasons to do with accessibility, speed, design, content, or responsiveness.
There are several potential reasons why the current website for Ascent Physiotherapy might be considered inappropriate or in need of improvement:

1. Accessibility: The site may not be fully accessible to users with disabilities. This includes lack of alt text for images, insufficient color contrast, or navigation that isn't keyboard-friendly.

2. Speed: If the website takes too long to load, it can frustrate users and lead to higher bounce rates. Optimizing images and minimizing scripts can help improve speed.

3. Design: The overall design may feel outdated or cluttered. A more modern, clean layout can enhance user experience and engagement.

4. Content: The content might be too dense or not engaging enough. Using clear headings, bullet points, and concise language can improve readability.

5. Responsiveness: If the site does not display well on mobile devices, it can alienate a significant portion of users. Ensuring the site is responsive and mobile-friendly is crucial.

6. Navigation: If the navigation is not intuitive, users may struggle to find the information they need. A clear and logical menu structure is essential.

7. SEO Optimization: The site may not be optimized for search engines, making it harder for potential clients to find it online. Implementing SEO best practices can improve visibility.

8. Call to Action: The call-to-action buttons (like "Book Now") should be prominent and easy to find. If they are not, users may miss important actions.

9. Visual Hierarchy The use of fonts, colors, and spacing should guide users' attention effectively. Poor visual hierarchy can make it difficult for users to process information.

10. Updates: If the content is outdated, it can give a negative impression of the business. Regular updates to news, services, and team information are important.

Addressing these issues can significantly enhance the user experience and effectiveness of the website.
